# yoctolog.vim
Here's some syntax highlighting for those of us who are (un?)fortunate enough to be reading lots of Yocto logs.

## Installation
With vim 8.0 or later you can simply put the yoctolog folder in ~/.vim/pack/bundle/start/ and it should work!


### [Vundle][]

[Vundle]: https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

```vim
Plugin 'arnstein/yoctolog.vim'
```

It should also work with other plugin managers, but only these two ways of installing has been through the Works on My Machine certification program.
