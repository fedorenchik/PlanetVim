SUMMARY                                         *capslock*

This plugin enables a software caps lock.  This is advantageous over a regular
caps lock in that normal mode commands, other buffers, and other applications
are unaffected.

                                        *capslock-i_CTRL-G_c* *capslock-gC*
The default insert mode mapping is <C-G>c, and the default normal mode map is
gC.  Additionally, <C-L> is mapped in insert mode if it is otherwise unused.
<Plug>CapsLockToggle, <Plug>CapsLockEnable, and <Plug>CapsLockDisable are
provided in normal, insert, and command line mode if you would prefer to
define your own maps.

By default, caps lock is automatically disabled after leaving insert mode for
the insert mode mappings, but must be explicitly disabled for the normal mode
mappings.  If you always want to use the latter method, make your insert mode
mapping call the normal mode one.

CapsLockStatusline() is provided to use inside %{} in 'statusline'.  This
returns "[Caps]" (or the optional first argument) if software caps lock is
enabled.  Here's an example usage that won't cause problems if capslock.vim is
missing:
>
        set statusline^=%{exists('*CapsLockStatusline')?CapsLockStatusline():''}
