This is a vim plugin to provide basic compatibility and quality-of-life tools
that integrate with the arduino IDE's commandline API. It requires the arduino
IDE to be installed.

The basic operations that are supported are compiling, uploading, and
debugging your projects from within vim. See the |arduino-commands| for
details.

Detailed descriptions and default values:~

                                                                *'g:arduino_cmd'*
The path to the 'arduino' command. By default it will look in your PATH, or in
Applications on Mac. >
  let g:arduino_cmd = '/usr/share/local/arduino/arduino'
<
                                                                *'g:arduino_dir'*
The path to your 'arduino' directory. Usually vim-arduino will be able to
detect it, but if it cannot you can set the value manually. This is used to
search for the built-in board definitions (i.e. the Uno and Nano) >
  let g:arduino_dir = '/usr/share/local/arduino'
<

                                                           *'g:arduino_home_dir'*
The path to your user's 'arduino' data directory. Usually vim-arduino will be
able to detect it, but if it cannot you can set the value manually. This is used
to search for board definitions installed by the IDE Board Manager. >
  let g:arduino_home_dir = $HOME . ".arduino15"
<

                                                         *'g:arduino_build_path'*
The path where the sketch will be built and all intermediate object files will
be placed. The final binary (.bin) can be found after building/verification in
the folder.
For a dynamic path you can following substitutions:
 - {file} is substituted with the current sketch file (.ino)
 - {project_dir} is substituted with the folder the sketch resides in
Usage of a build path can be disabled with g:arduino_build_path = ''.
If disabled, arduino ide chooses a temporary path and will do a full rebuild. >
  let g:arduino_build_path = "{project_dir}/build"
<

                                                       *'g:arduino_run_headless'*
Run the arduino command inside a Xvfb. Requires Xvfb to be installed and in the
PATH. >
  let g:arduino_run_headless = 1
<
                                                               *'g:arduino_args'*
Additional arguments that will be passed to the 'arduino' command during build
and upload. See

Command used to connect to the serial port for debugging. The strings '{port}'
and '{baud}' will be replaced with the port and baud values. >

Automatically set the baud rate by searching for 'Serial.begin()' >

                                                          *'g:arduino_use_slime'*
Allows vim-slime to send the command to tmux/screen/... .
See :help slime for configuration of slime. Disabled by default. >

Connect to this serial port when uploading & debugging. This is not set by
default. If not set, vim-arduino will attempt to guess which port to use. See
also |:ArduinoChoosePort| >
  let g:arduino_serial_port = /dev/ttyACM0
<

                                                  *'g:arduino_serial_port_globs'*

   and used when you start new vim sessions.

   If passed no arguments, open a list and let the user select one from the
   list. If there are any special options for the board (e.g. cpu) successive
   list selections will be opened for those.

:ArduinoChooseProgrammer [programmer]
   Set [programmer] to be the currently selected board. It should match the
   format of 'package:programmer'.

   If |g:arduino_programmer| is not set, the programmer passed in will be
   saved to disk and used when you start new vim sessions.

   If passed no arguments, open a list and let the user select one from the
   list.
