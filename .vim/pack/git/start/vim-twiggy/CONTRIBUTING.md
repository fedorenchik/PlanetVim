Contributing
============

This was the first vim plugin I ever wrote after finishing
[Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).
While I certainly have a different coding style these days, contributions should make some
kind of attempt to follow a similar style.

Please:

- **Comment each function with the appropriate** `{{{<indent-level>` **header**
  
  Normally this is just the function name without parens or arguments and no preceeding `s:`.
  
- **Respect the soft-limit line length of 100**
  
  ...so it fits in a github window but also because I'm big on shorter lines (I like to read
  code on my phone at the bar).
  
- **Line up operators in situations where it feels right**
  
  Yeeeah, your call on this one... just something to be aware of.  Personally, I don't code
  this way anymore, but I'm maintaining it in this project.

I will not accept your PR unless you:

- **Squash your commits into *one* atomic commit**

  This is technically unnecessary if you are adding an epic feature, but please get in touch
  with me before doing anything like that.
  
- **Write a good commit message**

  Follow the guidelines in [commit.style](https://commit.style/).
