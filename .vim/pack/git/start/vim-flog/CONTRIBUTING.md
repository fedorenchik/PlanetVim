# Contributing

The idea behind this plugin is to provide a fully featured Vim branch viewer as light as possible.
Take advantage of Vim and fugitive's builtin features instead of recreating them.
Let users customize how they use Flog so they can use their personal workflows and preferred interface.

## Running Tests

Ensure you have `ruby` installed and run `rake test`.
Tests are located at `t/*.vim` and use [vim-flavor](https://github.com/kana/vim-flavor).

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure changes to the code are simple, iterative, and consistent.
2. Run [vint](https://github.com/Kuniwak/vint) in the root directory and make any necessary changes.
3. Keep documentation easy to read, concise, and up-to-date.
