Library Viewer for Vim

Updated Jul 08, 2015 - Feb 18, 2016 (v1l)
Manual
This plugin uses the "nm" utility to present an overview of the contents 
of archive and object files. Its based on autocmds, and so to use it all 
one needs do is to open an archive (*.a), an object (*.o) file, or a shared 
library (*.so) by attempting to edit it. (formerly known as the archive/object visualizer)
