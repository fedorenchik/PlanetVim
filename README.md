This many menus because Vim _IS_ powerful, sorry!

## Mainline

* Make Vim Discoverable
* User-Friendly
* Easy to Use
* Solve Real-World Problems
* Tested with real projects (Linux Kernel, Vim, etc.)

* Supports only recent Vim version (this makes code **MUCH** simpler, faster and
robust)
* Will not clutter your dirs with *~ .*.sw[p-z] and other files

## Which version to use

Branches: stable, develop, testing

PlanetVim does not hide tools that it uses, just makes them easy to use and
discoverable, e.g. generally it will show which commands it runs and print
commands' output.
