## How to build Godot Engine:

## Guidelines

* Make Vim Discoverable
* User-Friendly
* Easy to Use
* Solve Real-World Problems
* Tested with real projects (Linux Kernel, Vim, etc.)

* Supports only recent Vim version (this makes code **MUCH** simpler, faster and
robust)
* Will not clutter your dirs with *~ .*.sw[p-z] and other files

## Which version to use

Branches:
* dev - main development branch (unstable)

PlanetVim does not hide tools that it uses, just makes them easy to use and
discoverable, e.g. generally it will show which command it runs and print
command's output, working directory of process and exit status.
